NarrEatR

A Dev BootCamp final project to make restaurant menus more accessible for visually impaired smartphone users.
An ISO app that extracts texts from an image taken from a smartphone and converts the text to speech.

The front end utilizes Ionic 2 and Angular 2, while the back end was created with Ruby on Rails.  Rack-CORS was used to connect both ends and establish cross-origin resource sharing.  PostgreSQL was used to store the database and Paperclip to convert images to active record friendly.  Amazon (AWS) was used for image cloud storage and App was deployed to Heroku.  Also Google Vision API was used for OCR recognition.  All styling utilizes bootstrap and materialize.  Testing were covered with Rails RSpec and Simplecov.
