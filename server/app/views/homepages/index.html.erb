          <h4>Our Mission</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Ben Newman was inspired to create NarrEatR after attending a local tech meet up group called Chi HackNight. This meet up group brings together local developers and activists to use their skills and knowledge to develop beautiful and meaningful applications to enrich Chicago's civic landscape with technology. The team was also inspired by our Dev BootCamp instructors and fellow students to challenge ourselves to build an app that was designed to be inclusive-first for users with visual impairment and other disabilities. 
          <br> 
          Visiting a restaurant may seem like an ordinary experience to most, but for some it can only be enjoyed with the assistance of someone else to read them the menu. NarrEatR allows you to take a picture of a menu and use your phone to hear your menu from your phone speakers or headphones. This mobile application was created to ensure everyone can enjoy the freedom and independence of a simple dining experience without the worry.
